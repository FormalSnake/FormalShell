# shellcheck shell=bash
# shellcheck disable=SC2034,SC2154  # dev/smoke.sh reads leg_* and supplies shot_dir, the *_bin paths and fail()
# --panel-keys opens the audio panel and drives it with real `wtype`
# keystrokes rather than the IPC shortcuts every other panel leg uses. This is
# the one thing that can prove row-level keyboard navigation reaches the
# surface at all, since the shared cursor state only ever moves from a real Qt
# key event.
#
# Down, Down, Return lands on the sink's mute row, and the proof is the sink
# itself: `wpctl get-volume` is read before and after, and the mute state has
# to have flipped. A frame pair alone could not carry that claim here, because
# this VM's bar redraws something (a clock digit, an animated glyph) on almost
# any 1-2s window, so two frames differ whether or not a key landed.
#
# The niri rig recorded the opposite outcome for the same sequence: four
# independently timed probes there never got a Down/Down/Return through to an
# IPC-opened panel, because Panel.qml's focus-prime dance is built for a real
# bar-cell click and that rig had no pointer to supply one. Hyprland hands the
# surface keyboard focus on its own, so the route works here.
