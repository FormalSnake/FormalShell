# shellcheck shell=bash
# shellcheck disable=SC2034,SC2154  # dev/smoke.sh reads leg_* and supplies shot_dir, iso_home, the *_bin paths and fail()
# --wheel (M47 D3): the mouse wheel scrolls a launcher view, and the cursor
# stays where it is. One notch moves it exactly one step, and a scroll far
# past the end stops on it. The wallpaper grid is the surface that reported the
# bug, so it is the one driven here, over a directory of 40 fixtures, which
# is enough rows to overflow the card whatever the output height does to the
# cap.
#
# wlrctl, not an IPC "scroll" verb: what needs proving is the pointer path
# end to end (a real zwlr_virtual_pointer_v1 axis event, into the layer
# surface, past the cell under it, into the flickable), and a shell-side
# call would skip exactly the part that was broken. Same line the tooltip
# leg draws for hover, including its relative-only pointer trick: the
# pointer is slammed into the corner first, then moved once from a known
# origin.
#
# The reading, not the frame, is the claim. Two screenshots of a scrolled
# grid look alike whether the cursor followed the wheel or not, so the
# assertion is `menu status`'s scrollTop against `picker status`'s cursor.
#
# The other half of the contract runs on the same timeline once the grid is
# closed: a notch on the bar's audio cell has to keep adjusting the sink.
# That is the one path `Cell` still accepts the wheel on (`Cell.wheeled` with
# a consumer that re-accepts), so a fix that made lists scroll by making
# every cell transparent to the wheel would pass the half above and silently
# break this one. wpctl reads the sink back, since no frame can show that a
# volume moved for the right reason.
#
# Between the two, a touchpad over the same grid, through dev/vpointer.py's
# `finger` frames (axis_source finger) and `lift` (axis_stop), which wlrctl
# cannot send. From the end, 100px of finger travel up has to move
# scrollTop by exactly the finger gain (scroll.rs FINGER_GAIN, 1.12). Then
# 200px down with the fingers held: a status read mid-gesture has to show
# scrollTop past scrollMax, by less than the stretch's 40px ceiling, and
# 400ms after the lift exactly on it again. Then a wheel notch down while
# already at the end, read five times through its glide: never past it.
#
# Last the coast after a flick (scroll.rs `Touchpad`), status read back to
# back behind a millisecond stamp each. 30px of fingers at 70 px/s lifted
# at once coasts nothing. From the top, seven 60px finger frames 8ms apart
# and a lift at once: scrollTop keeps rising after the lift, never back,
# slower in each third of the run, and stops within 1.3s, its coast no
# longer than one viewHeight (the cap). The same flick with a finger
# touching 150ms after the lift stops there, short of where the free one
# went. The same flick 5 notches short of the end runs into it: overscroll
# goes above 0 and stays under the 40px stretch cap, and it settles
# exactly on scrollMax with nothing stretched, the frame then showing the
# last row whole. The 100px of travel up above lifts after a 100ms pause,
# so it coasts nothing either.
