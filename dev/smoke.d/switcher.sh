# --switcher: Gala's Alt+Tab as a keyboard-only surface (M60 T6, the
# 2026-09-17 spec's Part 2), with live window thumbnails (owner, 2026-09-29).
# Three windows in one session, the cursor walked over IPC the way the
# compositor's bind walks it, and both halves of the claim at every step:
# what `switcher state` says the cursor is on, and the card as drawn.
#
# The three windows are the base run's own fixture window plus two more of
# the same app id, so all three captions resolve the same icon out of the
# isolated home's icon theme (#CE5D97, which nothing else in a frame is) and a
# caption carrying an icon is telling apart from an empty one by colour alone.
#
# A fourth window sits on workspace 2 and must not be offered (M64): Gala
# lists the active workspace's windows alone, and offering the rest is what
# made a quick Alt+Tab commit to a window elsewhere and take the compositor
# to it. The compositor's own client list is read beside `switcher state`, so
# a run where that fourth window never spawned cannot pass by having nothing
# to exclude.
#
# The thumbnails are ScreencopyViews and live only while the card is open:
# `switcher state` reports how many hold a frame (`captured`) and how many
# hold a capture source (`capturing`), which has to be all three while open
# and zero once the commit has closed the card and its fade has run out.
#
# Cell positions come from `switcher state` (`cells`, in output pixels as the
# card draws them) rather than from constants, since a thumbnail's width
# follows its window. The frames are read for the caption icon's pink at the
# centre of each cell's icon rect, and for the strip of cell fill left of each
# thumbnail. The selected cell takes the table's `switcher.cell` selected
# fill, so its strip differs from the other two while theirs match each
# other, and after one `switcher prev` that difference has moved one cell
# left. A patch read per cell rather than a colour compared against a
# constant: the fill is the wallpaper's own accent under matugen, and a leg
# naming a hex would be asserting the palette rather than the cursor.
#
# The switcher is on under every theme (`switcher.enabled`, default true), so
# the leg pins no preset and rides --pantheon or --retro for their material.
