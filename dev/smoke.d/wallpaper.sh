# crossfade to the gradient and photograph that. Two frames, because the two
# dither assertions read opposite things and neither can be made off the
# other's source.
#
# The retro dither is opt-in since M45, so the default run writes no
# `wallpaper.dither` key at all and this leg asserts the plain image reached
# the screen. SMOKE_WALLPAPER_DITHER=1 turns the opt-in on for one run and
# flips the assertion with it, so both sides of the setting are provable
# without a second flag.
#
# The same retheme also publishes the compositor's own palette, so the leg
# reads both hypr files back and then asks the running Hyprland what its
# active border actually is: the files being right proves the write, and only
# the running value proves the reload.
