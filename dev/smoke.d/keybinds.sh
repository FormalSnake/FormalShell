# shellcheck shell=bash
# shellcheck disable=SC2034,SC2154  # dev/smoke.sh reads leg_* and supplies shot_dir, the *_bin paths and fail()
# --keybinds: the launcher's parsed-binds route. The fixture is a real set of
# `bind =` lines written into this session's own hyprland.conf, and the route
# answers `hyprctl binds -j`, so what is asserted is that hyprland's own
# expanded bind table came back as rows carrying the fixture's chords and
# their actions.
#
# Two passes on the query, the same idiom the nix route uses: the hyprctl
# Process is async, so the first pass can land before it has exited. The rows
# are inert notes by construction (a bind acts on whatever has focus, and at
# Enter that is the launcher), so there is no activation to drive.
#
# The fixture carries one commented-out bind, which must NOT come back as a
# live row, and an argument holding "//" and braces, which must survive
# hyprland's config parser and the JSON round trip intact. An exact row count
# is what makes the commented-out assertion mean anything: the scaffold's
# base config declares no binds at all, so these are the whole table.
#
# ⚠️ RED against Hyprland 0.56.0, and deliberately so. `hyprctl binds -j`
# emits INVALID JSON there: from `modmask` on, every value sits under the
# previous key's name (the fixture's modmask 65 comes back as `"submap":
# "65"`, its key `slash` as `"keycode": slash` unquoted) and
# `allow_input_capture` has no value at all. JSON.parse throws on it, so
# keybinds.js's parseHyprlandBinds returns [] and the route answers NO BINDS.
# `hyprctl binds` (plain text, dumped beside it here) carries the same table
# correctly, which is what the route has to read instead. Until it does, this
# leg fails at that check with the compositor's own output attached.
