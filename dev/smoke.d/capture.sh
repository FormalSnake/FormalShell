# shellcheck shell=bash
# shellcheck disable=SC2034,SC2154  # dev/smoke.sh reads leg_* and supplies shot_dir, the *_bin paths and fail()
# --capture drives the shell's own region picker, a real Overlay-layer
# surface with Exclusive keyboard focus rather than slurp. `pick smart`
# opens it over a session holding one real tiled window, `key tab` cycles
# the selection, `key ctrl-return` commits the whole display, and the PNG
# that comes out is measured against what the compositor says the output is.
# Then the toolbar half: `key 4` lights REC SCREEN (the same setTool a click
# on the cell calls) and Return commits it into a real wf-recorder child.
# `pick region` plus `key escape` closes the leg on the cancel path, since a
# full-screen Overlay surface that outlives its own cancel is the worst
# failure this surface has.
#
# The window split is the other way round from niri, and that is the port:
# Hyprland reports a box for every window, so the fixture window has to
# arrive DRAWABLE and the named-only card stays empty (RegionPicker.qml's
# _unboxedWindows: "Empty on Hyprland"). Asserting a positive count either
# way is the point, since a picker that never enumerated windows at all
# would report zero of both and otherwise look identical.
#
# `key` is the rig's stand-in for real key delivery into an Exclusive-focus
# layer surface, the same split every other surface's IPC actions use.
#
# The recorder itself gets further here than it ever did under niri, where
# the dmabuf bind was rejected outright: it starts, captures and writes a
# real container. What it does not do on this software-rendered session is
# answer SIGTERM on its `-g` crop path, so the run ends in the truncated
# state RecordingService reports, and this leg says so on its own marker
# line rather than passing quietly or failing the whole port.
