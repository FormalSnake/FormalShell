# --hdr: HDR on an output that cannot do it. The rig's vkms card carries no
# EDID, so the honest answers are the whole contract here: `hdr status` says
# unsupported with a reason, every verb that would turn HDR on refuses with
# its error string and writes nothing to state.json, and the Display panel
# frame carries the dim "HDR unavailable" line under the output.
#
# The rule builder is held against the compositor: `hdr rule <output>` (the
# rule an enable would send, unsent) must restate the mode, position, scale,
# transform and vrr that `hyprctl monitors all -j` reports for the same
# output. The real toggle on a panel with HDR in its EDID is g815's to
# confirm by eye.
