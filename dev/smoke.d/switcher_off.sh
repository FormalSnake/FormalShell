# --switcher-off: the other half of --switcher (M60 T6). `switcher.enabled:
# false` never instantiates the surface at all, so the claim here is that the
# IPC target says so rather than accepting a call and doing nothing. A leg of
# its own because one session carries one settings.json. The setting is the
# user's rather than the theme's, so it rides --pantheon or --retro as well.
#
# All five verbs, not just one: `state` returning the error string is what a
# rig or a keybind sees, and `commit` is bound to the release of a modifier,
# so with the switcher off it is the verb that would fire most often of all.
