# shellcheck shell=bash
# shellcheck disable=SC2034,SC2154  # dev/smoke.sh reads leg_* and supplies shot_dir, iso_home, the *_bin paths and fail()
# --config-reload proves a settings.json whose SYMLINK is retargeted still
# reaches a running shell.
#
# That is what home-manager does on every activation, and it is the one write
# a file watch cannot see: inotify resolves the path when the watch is added,
# so the watch sits on the store file, which is immutable and never touched
# again. Swapping the symlink beside it produces no event at all, and the
# shell stopped seeing its own config for the rest of the session (g815,
# 2026-08-26: a rebuild moved bar.position and the bar stayed where it was
# until the service was restarted by hand).
#
# A plain rename over the path is NOT the same case and does not test this:
# it unlinks the inode the watch is on, which inotify does report, so that
# path has always worked. The drive below therefore builds the symlink shape
# first and waits for the shell to be reading through it, and only then
# retargets it, which is the write that goes unannounced.
#
# The bar is the readout because its edge is a whole-screen fact this rig can
# read off the compositor: the fixture starts it on the right, the retarget
# asks for left, and the assert holds the layer box before and after. A shell
# that never re-read the file leaves the strip on the right and this fails.
# This leg owns the `bar` key, so it does not combine with --bar-position,
# --chevron or --bar-layout, which write the same key.
