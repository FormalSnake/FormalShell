# --airplay: AirplayService against a PATH-shimmed `uxplay`. The real
# receiver decodes AirPlay's video into a GL texture, and this rig's card is
# the kernel's software `vkms` KMS device with no GL path at all, so the
# shim stands in for it the way --clipssh's does for a real ssh host: it
# speaks uxplay's own output contract (Airplay/model.js's header carries the
# exact line and file shapes, checked against FDH2/UxPlay's source) rather
# than one invented for the test.
#
# uxplay only prints its connect line and writes `-md`/`-ca`/`-dacp` once a
# real client shows up over the network, which this rig has no way to drive,
# so the shim does that at its own startup -- standing in for "a client is
# already connected" from the first frame -- and only the DISCONNECT half
# runs on the drive script's own clock: a trigger file it touches, which the
# shim polls for before it clears the three files and prints the drop line.
# That is what proves `active` (AirplayService's presence read, the `-dacp`
# file existing), the metadata and cover art, and MediaService's `airplay`
# media source (`_airplayRows`, gated on `active` and a non-empty title) all
# go back to idle rather than latching on.
