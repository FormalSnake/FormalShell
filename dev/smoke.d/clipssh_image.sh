# shellcheck shell=bash
# shellcheck disable=SC2034,SC2154  # dev/smoke.sh reads leg_* and supplies shot_dir, the *_bin paths and fail()
# --clipssh-image: the two paths that send an image over ssh without anyone
# first putting it on the clipboard and then finding the Clipssh route.
# `clipssh.autoSendImages` sends every image the moment it lands in history,
# and Shift+Enter on a history row sends that row's file. Both resolve a host
# out of `clipssh.alias` rather than off a row under a cursor, which is the
# half `--clipssh` cannot reach: its rows carry their own alias.
#
# The shim stands in for the binary the same way `--clipssh`'s does, and adds
# the one claim no frame can make. clipssh reads the clipboard and nothing
# else, so on every invocation it records the sha256 of what the clipboard
# actually held next to the alias it was handed. A send that reached
# ClipsshService with the right name while the clipboard still held the last
# transfer's reply text (or nothing) looks exactly like a working one from
# the outside; the digest is what separates them.
#
# The two sends are sequential because ClipsshService takes one transfer at a
# time. The order is load-bearing too: the shim reproduces clipssh's last act
# of wl-copying the remote path back as TEXT, so by the time the row is
# activated the image is off the clipboard, and the second digest matching is
# what proves Shift+Enter put it back rather than riding what the auto-send
# left there. That text is also why the row is reached through `menu filter
# image` rather than by index: it lands in history as a row of its own, ahead
# of the image, and the image row is the only one whose label matches.
