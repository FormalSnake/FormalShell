# shellcheck shell=bash
# shellcheck disable=SC2034,SC2154  # dev/smoke.sh reads leg_* and supplies shot_dir, the *_bin paths and fail()
# --use drives the shell the way a hand does rather than the way a leg
# usually does: real keys through real compositor binds (wtype), a real
# virtual pointer for moves, clicks and the wheel (wlrctl), fast and
# overlapping. No IPC call drives anything; `bar room`, `menu status` and
# `panel state` are only read, for where the cells are and what the shell
# believes is open at each checkpoint. Every step also runs a burst of
# frames (grim in a loop, ~50 a second here) into `use/<step>/`, named by
# the millisecond each grab started, for reading by eye.
#
# What it asserts, each one a glitch real use hit while every scripted leg
# passed (2026-10-09):
#   - The launcher key opens the launcher after Escape closed it. Escape at
#     the root closed the card but left the launcher's model open, so the
#     next press "closed" an invisible launcher and the typing that followed
#     went to the focused window.
#   - Escape walks back one level and the launcher stays open on the root.
#   - A bar cell clicked while another cell's panel is open opens its own
#     panel. The panel's full-output surface sits over the bar and took the
#     click as a dismiss, so every second cell clicked in a row did nothing.
#   - Three fast clicks on one cell leave its panel open. The third lands
#     while the card is still leaving, through the strip.
#   - A theme mode flip under the open launcher and under an open panel
#     moves each card's fill with it. Both kept the old fill under the new
#     ink, so every word on them vanished.
#   - A wallpaper change or a theme mode flip never blanks the bar: every
#     frame of the strip through the recolour carries cells. The bar used to
#     rebuild every cell and grow each one out of nothing.
#
# Nothing backed by the system bus or the owner's audio is touched: on a
# real host the nested shell shares them, so the network, bluetooth, audio
# and battery cells, their panels and launcher levels are never opened, let
# alone driven. The clock and now playing cells carry the panel clicks, the
# wheel goes over the workspaces cell, and the launcher's levels are
# Keybinds and Emoji.
#
# The layout carries a chevron (chevron.sh's) so its second bar is part of
# the clicking. The fixture window stays: it is what a stray key lands in.
