# shellcheck shell=bash

# --join photographs the join mid-flight. At full speed a card is on the line
# for about as long as one screencopy takes, so every open here runs at a
# tenth of its speed (`debug motionScale`) and is sampled across the travel:
#
#   a  `panel open network` with no cell, which lands against the far end of
#      the bar, a `screenPadding` off the screen's own edge
#   b  the chevron's second bar
#   c  a panel opened by a click on a cell inside that second bar
#
# Every frame is saved for reading by eye; four claims are asserted, the
# first two on an attached frame of case a and the last two on case c:
#
#   the seam (M57 D1)   the line's own row inside the gap must be byte-equal
#                       to the bar's fill two rows above it: the bar paints
#                       that row, and a card whose fill starts on it too
#                       leaves a line across the whole gap wherever the
#                       surfaces are translucent.
#   the wall (M57 D2)   case a rests a screenPadding off the output and its
#                       fillet wants radiusXl, so there is no room for one:
#                       the attached silhouette runs out to the screen's own
#                       edge instead, and the output's last column carries
#                       card fill from under the line down to the shape's far
#                       edge. At rest that column is bare desktop again.
#   the bud (M57 D3)    case c's 380px card hangs off a second bar a third of
#                       its width. On the frames taken before it lets go of
#                       that bar's edge, nothing it paints under that edge may
#                       lie outside the bar's own columns, and at rest it is
#                       the full card again. Everything the claim is measured
#                       against, the second bar's rect and the card's resting
#                       rect, is read off the rig's own pixels: the strip is
#                       as wide as its cells measured themselves at, which is
#                       no number to pin.
#   the border (M57)    and on a frame where that same card is far enough out
#                       to read its sides and still widening, no row
#                       well inside it carries the card's own fill at its
#                       outermost painted column on either side. A clip taken
#                       along the line from the undeformed rect cuts the
#                       border off whichever side the deform, or the last of
#                       the attach clock, has carried past it.
#
# Every probe is pinned to the unframed rig's own numbers, so `--join
# --frame` photographs the ring case and leaves them out; that combination is
