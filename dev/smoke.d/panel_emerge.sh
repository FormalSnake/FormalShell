# --panel-emerge proves the drawer open (M53 addendum 2026-09-09): a panel
# comes out from under the bar rather than fading in where it will end up. The
# card is displaced behind the bar's inner line by its own height while closed
# and travels out from under it, so its visible height grows from nothing to
# the whole card and no part of it is ever drawn inside the bar's own band.
#
# Measured down the card's own centre column, and a probe is "covered" when it
# is NOT byte-identical to the same probe in the closed output: something the
# desktop does not draw is being drawn there, which is the card.
#
# Both halves of that are the deform's doing (M54 D7). The card arrives
# squashed and unwinds through its rest, so a probe cannot ask whether what it
# sees is what the settled card draws: for the tail of every open it is the
# same card a few percent narrower. What the deform does not move is the
# midpoint of the anchored edge, which is what its matrix is centred on, so
# the card's centre column stands still horizontally however hard it is
# squashed and a probe on it is inside the card whenever the card has reached
# that far down. The card fill is `card` at `surfaceOpacity` over a near-black
# desktop, so "not the desktop" is a byte difference at every depth, whether
# the pixel under the probe is fill or a row's own ink.
#
# The ladder sits deep in the card (60%, 75%, 88% and 97% of its height) on
# purpose. The travel is front-loaded even on `spatial`: over half of it is
# gone in the first fifth of the clock, and probes near the top would be
# covered before the first frame lands.
#
# The card rect is not hardcoded: it comes out of the difference between the
# frame with the panel open and the frame without it, cropped below the bar
# first so the cell's own panel mark is not in the box. Below the card's
# shoulders too (M54 D6): the two fillets reach a `radiusXl` outside the
# card's own sides for the first `radiusXl` under the bar's line, so a box
# that took them in would measure the silhouette rather than the card and
# put the gutter probes below on bare desktop.
#
# Ten samples, each armed BEFORE the ipc call rather than after it: grim's
# own start-up costs about as much as the travel does, so a capture asked for
# once the call has returned lands past the end of it every time (again
# panel_handoff.sh's finding). Arming first spends that start-up during the
# round trip instead.
