# --shoulders proves the join (M54 D6): a card hanging off the bar and the
# bar's own inward line are one silhouette, not a card parked against a line.
# The bar opens a gap of the card's rect plus a fillet's radius at either end,
# and Components/Shoulders.qml draws a concave quarter arc into each of those
# two ends, running from the card's side out to the line.
#
# Nothing consumes Shoulders until M54 Task 3, so the leg publishes the join
# itself over `debug join <edge> <x> <width>` and the shell's own preview
# surface (Surfaces/Debug/JoinPreview.qml) hangs one card at that rect. The
# card's depth is that file's business; everything asserted here is along the
# bar.
#
# Two claims, read two different ways:
#
# The gap is the shell's own number, off `debug dump`'s `bar[].line`, the two
# segment rects the strip actually laid out. Its two ends have to sit exactly
# `radiusXl` outside the card's rect, and `radiusXl` comes out of the same
# dump, so `theme.radius` or the retro preset moves the expectation with the
# shape rather than breaking the leg.
#
# The seam is pixels, because no number can say whether the line and the arc
# meet: at the gap's own end column the bar's line row must carry the border
# ink both one column outside the gap (the line's last pixel) and at the gap's
# first column (the arc's first), so there is neither a gap pixel nor a second
# line. The two reference colours are sampled out of the same frame, the
# border off the line well clear of the join and the card fill out of the
# middle of the card, so nothing here restates a palette.
#
# The frame this reads is deliberately cut at the bar's line row and below it:
# the clock sits in the centre region right over the join and reprints itself
# between two grabs, and a crop that took in the bar's cells would differ
# between the open and closed frames for a reason that has nothing to do with
# the join.
