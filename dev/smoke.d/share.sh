# shellcheck shell=bash
# shellcheck disable=SC2034,SC2154  # dev/smoke.sh reads leg_* and supplies shot_dir, the *_bin paths and fail()
# --share proves the menu's SHARE route against the real packaged
# localsend-cli (M75 Task 5 restructured the route around it; M17's
# GUI-only shape is now the fallback, providers.js's sharePeerEntries).
#
# nix/package.nix wraps localsend-cli onto the `formalshell` binary's own
# PATH via `--suffix`, so it is unconditionally present for anything
# launched through `result/bin/formalshell` in this rig: no PATH trick can
# shadow it off, the wrapper re-suffixes its own store path onto whatever
# PATH it inherited regardless. That makes the CLI-present branch the only
# one this rig can honestly exercise end to end; the CLI-absent fallback
# shape (M17's Clipboard/Pick From History/Receive-launches-the-GUI rows)
# is proven instead by tst_menu_share.qml's sharePeerEntries(false, ...)
# tests, which build the tree directly against fixture data and need no
# real binary at all -- the old spawn-and-shadow dance this leg used to run
# tested exactly that fallback, which this rig can no longer honestly
# produce, so it isn't reproduced here.
#
# What is under test: the route resolves and renders (a screenshot, read by
# eye, of the honest "No devices found" state -- this rig's isolated
# network genuinely has no second LocalSend peer to discover; a real
# two-instance transfer is Task 7's own dedicated leg), and the
# `localsend` IPC target's status/scan/peers round trip against the real
# CLI process LocalsendService actually spawns.
