# shellcheck shell=bash
# shellcheck disable=SC2034,SC2154  # dev/smoke.sh reads leg_* and supplies shot_dir, the *_bin paths and fail()
# --record drives the `record` target through a real wf-recorder child, start
# to finished GIF. `record start screen desktop` answers with the destination
# path synchronously, `record status` has to report active:true against that
# exact path, and the bar is screenshotted mid recording (record-active.png),
# the only state Indicators.qml's recording cell exists in. `record stop`
# then polls until `active` goes false (SIGTERM asks wf-recorder to finalize
# the container rather than truncate it) and until `finalizing` settles too
# (RecordingService's own trim/loudnorm pass), so the ffprobe read lands on
# a settled file rather than one mid-rewrite: it must show a positive
# duration and an audio stream. Finally `record gif <path>` runs the two-pass
# transcode and the result has to be a real GIF matching status's own
# lastGifPath.
#
# settings.json sets recording.noDmabuf, the one key software rendering makes
# non-optional: there is no GPU buffer to import in this session. Every other
# recording key stays at its default so this proves those defaults resolve,
# which is why the assertions read the destination back out of `record
# status` rather than off a path this leg chose. `desktop` audio needs only
# the VM's own pipewire null-sink monitor, so the finalize pass has a real
# audio track to normalize. webcam is on to exercise the overlay path
# against a machine with no /dev/video* at all: the honest WEBCAM
# UNAVAILABLE leg, which resolves on an empty device glob and costs nothing.
