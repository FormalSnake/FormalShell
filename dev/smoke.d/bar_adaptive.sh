# --bar-adaptive: the wingpanel band deciding its own paint off the
# wallpaper under it (M60 T3, the 2026-09-17 spec's Part 2). Four wallpapers
# in one session, each set over IPC, and for each of them both halves of the
# claim: the paint the shell says it settled on (`bar paint`, the three
# numbers behind it included) and the band as drawn, read off a patch of the
# frame in the rows above the cells.
#
# The four, in the order they are driven, with the paint each has to give on
# this rig's dark mode:
#   a flat #e6e6e6 field (mean 230, no spread)      -> dark, no fill at all
#   a flat #1e1e1e field (mean 30, no spread)       -> light, no fill at all
#   half black, half white (spread 127)             -> translucentDark
#   the dark field with the fixture window full     -> maximized, solid
# The fourth band is not in its frame: Hyprland draws a fullscreen window
# above the top layer the bar is on, which is what the chrome auto-hide
# exists for, so that case is asserted off `bar paint` and the whole-state
# dump and its frame is the window.
# The busy case is a coarse split rather than pixel noise on purpose: the
# sampler decodes the wallpaper small, and a smooth downscale averages a
# per-pixel pattern away while a half-and-half field keeps its spread at any
# scale.
#
# It pins `theme.preset` itself, so it needs no --pantheon (and does not
# fight one), and it pins `fullscreen.hideChrome` off: the auto-hide takes
# the bar off the overlay layer while a window covers the output, and the
# solid paint is exactly what a session that turned that off gets to see.
