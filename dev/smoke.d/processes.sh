# shellcheck shell=bash
# shellcheck disable=SC2034,SC2154  # dev/smoke.sh reads leg_* and supplies shot_dir, the *_bin paths and fail()
# --processes: the process table, which is the bottom half of the launcher's
# monitor view, so this leg summons that route and types into its own search
# field. The fixtures are copies of bash (not coreutils `sleep`, which
# nixpkgs builds as one multi-call binary that exits at once under any other
# name) spinning on a builtin loop: findable by a whole 15-byte comm, the
# busiest thing on the machine so the CPU column has something real to show,
# and dead on TERM with no foreground child to wait out.
#
# The kill runs through `menu activate` rather than `monitor kill`, since
# that is the rig's Enter stand-in and so exercises the whole path a keypress
# takes. It is called TWICE on purpose: this route arms on the first press
# and fires on the second, and the `kill -0` written between the two is what
# proves the arming press did not already kill.
