# and reads the whole strip back. Six items with no visible limit is the
# claim: every one is its own cell, and bounding a long strip is the bar
# chevron's job. `tray status` has to report all six and no drawer, bucket or
# expand key at all; `tray activate` has to reach that one item over D-Bus
# (the stub's own --activate-file is the evidence, not the IPC reply); the
# shell-owned menu has to open, walk two rows and fire the third; and the
# launcher's tray route has to be searchable from inside while staying
# invisible from the root.
