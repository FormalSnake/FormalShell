# shellcheck shell=bash
# shellcheck disable=SC2034,SC2154  # dev/smoke.sh reads leg_* and supplies shot_dir, iso_home, the *_bin paths and fail()
# --localsend: a real loopback transfer into the shell's own receiver, the
# check --share's own header defers to this leg for. `localsend.receive`
# pins the shell's `localsend-cli recv` child to a fixture directory, and
# this leg's drive script runs a SECOND, independent `localsend-cli send`
# process (the same packaged binary, resolved a second time by
# need_localsend_cli below) against it over `--ip 127.0.0.1`, standing in
# for a real second device the way --wifi's two real hostapd radios do for
# a real access point.
#
# What is under test is the shell's receiver end to end: LocalsendService
# spawns the real CLI, the file lands in the real fixture directory over the
# real LocalSend v2 HTTPS handshake (LocalsendService.qml's header on why no
# `--https=false`), `recv`'s own `Recv file` log line raises the RECEIVED toast, and
# files something else writes into the same directory (a browser download,
# here a `cp` and a `.part` temp name before the transfer and a second
# `cp` after it) raise none: exactly one toast for the run. A sha256 match against the
# source file is the one claim a screenshot cannot make: a truncated or
# corrupted transfer would still produce a same-named file and a toast.
#
# The reverse direction -- the shell's own `localsend send` IPC route
# against a second real `recv` -- is NOT run here. 0w0mewo/localsend-cli's
# `recv` and `send` (cmd/recv/recv.go, internal/models/discovery.go
# NewDeviceInfo) carry no port flag at all: the receive port is the
# hardcoded LocalSend default, 53317, so a second `recv` on this same host
# can only ever collide with the first one already bound to it. A real
# second-device test of that direction needs a second host, which is
# g815/e1504g territory (CLAUDE.md's macOS verification loop section), not
# this rig; `--share`'s own `localsend send`/`localsend peers` IPC round
# trip is what this rig can honestly still prove of that half.
