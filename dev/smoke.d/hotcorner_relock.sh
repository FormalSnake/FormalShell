# --hotcorner-relock drives the one hot corner sequence a layer dump cannot
# reach: fire the bottom-right corner, unlock, and leave the cursor exactly
# where it was. Unlocking puts the corner surface back under a pointer that
# never moved, and firing on the enter that comes with it relocked the
# session on the spot (owner report, 2026-08-26).
#
# The proof is the pause in the middle: three seconds of `lock isLocked`
# reading false with no pointer event of any kind in between. The leg then
# moves the pointer out, waits past the re-arm cooldown and moves back in,
# which has to lock again, so the fix is not just "the corner stopped
# working".
#
# The corner surfaces are destroyed and rebuilt under the plate, which is
# what makes this leg fail on the old rule rather than merely pass on the new
# one. Instrumenting the corner here showed the compositor sending it an
# enter 51ms after the unlock under a cursor that had not moved since the
# lock: real, but harmless to a surface that remembered firing. The surfaces
# do not always live that long. `Corners.windows` is resolved from the output
# list and the config, so an output leaving and coming back rebuilds every
# corner, which on a laptop is what closing and opening the lid does while
# the session is locked, and a rebuilt corner has nothing to remember. The
# rig has one head and no lid, so `hotCorners.enabled` is written false and
# then true instead: same model going empty and refilling, same fresh
# surfaces, and it can be made to happen on cue. The lock plate is above the
# Top layer throughout, so the new surfaces get no pointer of their own until
# the unlock hands it over.
#
# wlrctl and wtype, not any IPC shortcut: the whole claim is about real
# pointer enter/leave and a real unlock, and LockIpc deliberately has no
# "type this password" verb (see its header). wlrctl's protocol is relative
# only, so every move starts by slamming the pointer into the top-left
# corner, which the compositor clamps, and travels from there. Top-left is
# `none` by default, so that origin fires nothing.
