# shellcheck shell=bash
# shellcheck disable=SC2034,SC2154  # dev/smoke.sh reads leg_* and supplies shot_dir, the *_bin paths and fail()
# --center: a notify-send of this leg's own, then a long enough wait for the
# model's 8s popup timeout to move it (and --notify's, when the two flags
# combine) into the `pending` tier the centre lists. The wait is 14s rather
# than the 9 that timeout alone would need: on the VM's software renderer
# the shell reaches the bus several seconds after the drive script starts,
# so a notification's own clock begins well after its notify-send. It fires
# at sleep 2, ahead of --notify's own four, so that when the two legs
# combine it is the oldest group and therefore the one the popup cap evicts
# into pending: --notify's frames need all four of its cards alive.
# Combining also leaves the critical popup sticky in the popup layer, which
# is what makes the suppression claim readable: Center.qml is a fixed
# right-anchored card wherever notifications.position puts the toast stack,
# so Toasts.qml drops its whole stack for as long as the centre is open and
# center.png shows the centre alone.
#
# `notifications status` brackets a showHistory round trip (the IPC stand-in
# for the bell cell's own click, which calls the same center.open()/close()),
# and `dismissOne` is asserted here rather than in --notify: it drops the
# front toast, which would change what that leg's own frames show.
#
# Then the M48 D3 claim, which needs a history longer than the output is
# tall: thirty notifications, the centre reopened over them, and a real
# scroll wheel through the row list. The card's own height is read off
# `notifications status` rather than measured in the frame, since the
# surface behind it is the whole output either way and a short card and a
# clipped one photograph the same.
