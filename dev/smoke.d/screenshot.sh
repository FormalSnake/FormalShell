# shellcheck disable=SC2034,SC2154  # dev/smoke.sh reads leg_* and supplies shot_dir, the *_bin paths and fail()
# --screenshot drives the `screenshot` IPC target's two non-picker routes.
# First the region/cancel round trip: `screenshot region` starts a real
# themed slurp, which blocks on a drag no headless run can supply (the exact
# stuck state the cancel path exists for), proven by pgrep plus
# capturing:true; `screenshot cancel` then has to kill it and settle to
# capturing:false / lastCancelled:true / empty lastError with no file
# written. Then the full capture in the same session: `screenshot full`
# replies synchronously with the destination path while the grim/wl-copy
# pipeline it starts runs on, and wl-paste's own type list is what proves
# the copy half landed.
#
# No screenshot.directory in the settings fixture on purpose: the capture
# landing under the isolated HOME's Pictures/Screenshots is what proves the
# documented default resolves. The run's own smoke.png, taken at the usual
# 8s, additionally carries the SCREENSHOT CANCELLED and SCREENSHOT SAVED
# toasts. Slurp's overlay look and a real drag stay host-trial: this rig has
# no synthetic pointer.
