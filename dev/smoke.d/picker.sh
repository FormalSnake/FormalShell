# --picker: the wallpaper picker, which is the launcher's grid route rather
# than a surface of its own. `summon` opens it, `choose` is the same action
# Enter or a click on a cell takes (exposed over IPC because no synthetic
# pointer or key delivery into an OnDemand layer surface exists here), and
# `theme status` is what proves the pick actually became the wallpaper.
#
# The second half of the route is the generic image selector: `picker select`
# opens the same grid against a caller's directory and token, and the choose
# that follows has to answer that request with `{token, value}` in
# picker-selection.txt, the same request/answer handshake MenuIpc's select()
# writes to menu-selection.txt.
#
# Then the Dark/Light half: the staged subdirectories are moved in
# underneath the running shell, which also proves the scan re-runs per entry
# (a listing cached at startup would still report the flat set), and `picker
# variant light` is the segmented switcher's own action over IPC. The route
# is left open so the run's own screenshot is the grid.
#
# picker_done_path is this leg's own finish marker: the picker and the
# clipboard routes are the same launcher surface, so a run carrying both has
# the clipboard leg wait on this file rather than summoning over the grid.
