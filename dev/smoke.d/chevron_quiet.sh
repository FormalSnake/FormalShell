# --chevron-quiet asks the one thing --chevron does not: that the chevron's
# second bar OPENS quiet. The card is built fresh on every open, so its cells
# measure themselves for the first time while it is arriving, and with the
# layout rule armed (M53 D2) every one of them grew from nothing, slid its
# neighbours along the rail behind it and inflated the card around the lot,
# on every single open (owner, 2026-09-09: "every time there's an animation
# moving the icons and text, which is annoying"). The card's own entrance
# stays; what must not be there is a second movement inside it.
#
# Same fixture as --chevron, so the group in the card is the same five cells,
# which is why the two cannot share a session: both own bar.layout and both
# drive the same chevron.
#
# The card is opened and shut three times under a burst of captures of the
# band it hangs in, and two things are read off them:
#
#   width  no capture taken while the card was OPENING caught it narrower
#          than the card it settles on. A card that opens around its cells
#          starts at its padding alone and grows, so a capture inside the
#          entrance catches it.
#
#          "the card it settles on" is the settled silhouette less its two
#          fillets (M54 D6): a joined card carries a concave shoulder a
#          `radiusXl` outside each of its sides, in the first `radiusXl`
#          under the bar's line, and those are the last part of it to come
#          out from behind that line. So a frame caught mid-entrance is the
#          card's own width and a settled one is the card plus both fillets,
#          and comparing the two raw would call a perfectly rigid card 16%
#          narrow. The radius comes off `debug dump` rather than a constant,
#          so `theme.radius` moves it.
#   quiet  three captures taken back to back once the entrance is over, and
#          two more half a second apart after them, are byte-identical: once
#          the card is up, nothing inside it moves on its own.
#
# Only the opening window counts toward the width claim, and the window is
# read off the expand calls' own stamps rather than off the pictures: a card
# on its way OUT measures narrow too, but for a reason that is not this
# leg's (it is fading, and a card at a third of its opacity has only its
# border left over the threshold below).
#
# ⚠️ The width claim is a guard here, not the proof. This rig commits the
# card's first frame ~130ms behind the ipc call and cannot sample faster than
# ~60ms even capturing the band alone (`grim -g`, a tenth of the pixels, runs
# no quicker than a full frame did). The entrance is `spatial` (M54 D2), long
# enough that several samples land inside it, but a card growing around its
# cells is still only measurably narrow while its cells are measuring
# themselves, which is the first frame or two of it.
# tests/tst_overflow_quiet.qml is where the gate itself is pinned. Do not
# tighten the sampling to chase it; the lanes below already lock in step
# under load.
#
# The quiet claim only means anything if the band is quiet at rest, so the
# settled capture is checked against a second one half a second later before
# any of it is believed: a cell repainting on its own would otherwise read as
# layout motion that is not there.
