# shellcheck shell=bash

# --gpu: the monitor surfaces against a hybrid Intel + NVIDIA laptop this rig
# is not. Two PATH shims draw it, the same hermetic-producer line the clipssh
# shim draws, and neither invents a /sys entry:
#
#   nvidia-smi  the collector already resolves it off PATH, so a shim
#               printing the owner's real g815 row makes the whole
#               collector -> parseNvidia -> mergeGpu -> render path real.
#               `[N/A]` is a value nvidia-smi genuinely emits for fan speed
#               on a laptop GPU and has to come out unavailable, never 0.
#   sh          the @drm half has no such seam: the collector reads
#               /sys/class/drm itself. So the shim goes one level up, onto
#               the collector's own view. It recognises exactly the one
#               `sh -c` carrying that glob, runs it through the REAL shell so
#               every other section stays this machine's own honest /proc,
#               and hands back tests/fixtures/gpu-hybrid.txt's @drm rows in
#               place of that section's own. Every other `sh -c` execs
#               straight through, GpuService's own nvidia-offload/prime-run
#               probe included, which must keep answering "neither" since the
#               env-var offload path is what this leg proves.
#
# The @drm section is replaced rather than appended to, which the niri rig
# never had to decide: its VM held no cards at all, while this session
# renders on a real vkms card that enumerates as card0, the same id the
# fixture's dGPU carries. Two cards under one id is a machine that cannot
# exist, and it renders like one: the launcher's route keys its rows on the
# card id, so the run that appended drew the vkms card twice and the NVIDIA
# card not at all. So for the one command that reads /sys/class/drm, this
# machine's own cards are out of view and the fixture pair is the whole card
# list, asserted as exactly two.
#
# Then the claim no screenshot can make: `monitor launch` against a fixture
# .desktop whose Exec is a probe writing its own argv and environment to a
# file, read back to confirm all four offload variables reached the child and
# that the Exec's %U field code did not.
