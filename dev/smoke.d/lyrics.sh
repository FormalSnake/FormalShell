# --lyrics (M56 P3/P5/P9/P11/P14): three real MPRIS players. Since P14, a
# lookup starts a second after ANY key change, panel open or closed, so all
# three cache files (two `.json`, one `.miss`) are written straight into the
# isolated XDG_CACHE_HOME in `leg_lyrics_fixture`, off the fixture's own
# known ffmpeg duration, before the session (and any player in it) even
# exists: there is never a moment where a key is live with no file behind
# it, which a select-then-write ordering could no longer promise once the
# wait was no longer gated on the panel being closed. `dev/smoke.d/README.md`
# still calls this the file contract; nothing here needs a leg of its own to
# know when another one is done, since the marker chain below only has to
# serialise the player-specific waits, not the seeding.
#
# Track1 carries a syllable line, a background line whose own end runs
# ridiculously past the next main line's start, and a duet turn (spec
# P1/P4/P5): seeding the other two tracks below has no fixed duration (each
# select waits on the real player's own MPRIS registration), so the overlap
# the duet-lit poll waits for is built to still be true minutes later rather
# than sized to a guessed setup time. Track2's
# cache has line timing only and no `words`, so `LyricsService.lines`
# synthesises them client-side (P4): the same two-word line repeats every
# 20s for the length of the file, held alternately for 16s and for 4s, so
# whichever repeat happens to be active once this leg gets around to
# selecting it, the fraction of its own span the shell reports is what the
# polls below read, not a wall-clock guess. Track3
# gets an empty `.miss` marker, the seven-day fresh-miss path, never asked
# of a provider at all.
#
# The claims: `media lyrics` reaches `synced`/`quality:2`/`estimated:false`
# for track1, its `active`/`secondary` moving to the exact pair kopuz's rule
# produces once the duet line starts while the background line is still
# running (P5's own worked example, not a made-up one: see the fixture's own
# comment below); a real wlrctl wheel notch over the pane's own on-screen
# rect (found the same way the panel-width check already does, a pixel diff
# between a bare frame and one with the panel open) takes `follow` to false,
# and selecting track2 re-arms it; track2 reaches `quality:1` with every
# words line `estimated:true` and its wipe partway along a row in a frame,
# read off the row's own ink rather than trusted from IPC alone;
# track3 reaches `none` with the panel narrower, as M55 already proved;
# selecting track1 back grows the panel again across a burst of frames that
# all share the narrow card's own centre, which is the centre of the bar
# cell that opened it (the growth travels both edges); and that burst's
# settled frame carries the lit line broken inside a chunk wider than the
# pane, read as the brightest ink stopping short of the viewport's clip.
#
# Two more since M69. The reopen claim: a wheel takes `follow` off, the panel
# is closed with the track still playing and opened again with no track
# change between, and the column is back on the song. Closing is the one way
# out of the wheel takeover that leaves none of spec P9's own re-arms
# reachable (they all live inside an open panel), which is what left a
# reopened pane parked where the wheel had put it minutes earlier, reading as
# the song having run ahead of the lyrics (owner, 2026-09-18).
#
# The line-change claim: track1 carries an mpv IPC socket, so the tail of the
# run seeks it back over its own chained boundaries and photographs two
# consecutive line changes, one into a line that fits on a row (15s) and one
# into the line that wraps (25s). Each frame's ink is read as a column of row
# means down the pane, and the two things that hold are that the pane never
# empties out while a change is in flight, and that the brightest row, which
# is the lit line, is on one place across the tail of each burst rather than
# still drifting. A row that resized itself as it lit moved every row under
# it and the scroll's own target with them, so the column was still chasing
# a line seconds after it had started singing (owner, 2026-09-18).
#
# Four more since M71, all four owner-reported on a real host on 2026-09-18.
#
# The wrapped-line claim: track1's line3 runs one row of words and then a
# chunk the pane cannot hold across two more, and the tail of the run pauses
# the player at 27.5s and at 30.6s to photograph the wipe on the first row
# and on the second. Every patch is measured against its own row's ink, and
# the two levels are taken from the same frame, so what is asserted is the
# order the rows light in: rows above the wipe fully sung, the row it is on
# sung to the wipe and no further, rows under it untouched. One gradient
# over the whole block instead lit every row left of a single x, so a word on
# the second row read as sung before the first row had finished.
#
# The room claim: the rows the pane draws against the rows its own height
# holds, counted off the frame as bands of ink and compared with the crop's
# height over the row pitch. A depth ramp that bottomed out three rows from
# the anchor left everything past it at the floor, so a pane with room for
# ten lines drew four and emptied out under them.
#
# The note claim: track2's 4s gaps are past the seamless carry and under
# kopuz's own instrumental threshold, which is the stretch that used to leave
# the pane with no lit row and no note at all; its 16s gaps are past both.
# Both now carry one, `media lyrics` reports the note itself as the active
# row for the stretch, and three frames show a line of words, then the note
# alone centred in the column, then the next line with nothing behind it
# still filled in.
#
# The rate claim: the same two words held for 16s and for 4s, each
# photographed at the same fraction of its own span, with the sung ink read
# as a fraction of the row's own ink. A wipe capped at WIPE_MAX_SECONDS a
# chunk snapped each word and waited, so the long line sat a whole word ahead
# of its own clock while the short one landed on the beat.
