# shellcheck shell=bash
# shellcheck disable=SC2034,SC2154  # dev/smoke.sh reads leg_* and supplies shot_dir, the *_bin paths and fail()
# --headset-card drives the headset connect card (new in the Rust shell, spec
# 2026-10-06-rust-rewrite.md under R7) through FORMALSHELL_SMOKE_BLUETOOTH.
# The VM has no Bluetooth controller, so the leg exports the variable as
# `@<file>`: a JSON device list the shell reads again whenever the file
# changes, which is how it connects and disconnects a device on this rig
# (`address`, `name`, `connected`, and for this seam `icon` and `battery`).
#
# What it proves, off the shell's own `headset card mapped` and `unmapped`
# log lines and the frames:
#  1. A device connected at startup raises no card.
#  2. A headphone going from disconnected to connected raises one carrying
#     its icon, its name, "Connected" and one ring from BlueZ's battery.
#  3. A real pointer parked on the card holds it past its four seconds, and
#     the pointer leaving then dismisses it.
#  4. The same device disconnecting and reconnecting a second later raises
#     none.
#  5. A pair of AirPods (the librepods status file staged first) raises a
#     card with one ring each for left, right and case off the earbuds
#     backend, and the pointer leaving the card dismisses it.
#  6. Escape, typed by wtype (a real virtual keyboard) into a foot window
#     that has the focus and never loses it, dismisses a card held up by the
#     pointer parked on it, through the
#     non-consuming bind the card adds while it is up: one Escape bind in
#     `hyprctl binds` with the card up and none after, the active window
#     the same foot throughout, and the letters typed around the Escape
#     reaching foot with the Escape between them.
#  7. With do-not-disturb on in state.json a connect raises none.
#
# The pointer is wlrctl, a real virtual-pointer client, for the reason
# tooltip.sh documents: only one sends the surface a pointer enter.
