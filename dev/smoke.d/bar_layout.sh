# shellcheck shell=bash
# shellcheck disable=SC2034,SC2154  # dev/smoke.sh reads leg_* and supplies shot_dir, the *_bin paths and fail()
# --bar-layout points bar.layout at a left region led by six bar.modules
# entries, swapped ahead of the reordered builtins (activeWindow before
# workspaces, away from the default): one `command` module printing known
# Waybar-JSON, four more each exercising one of CommandModule.qml's failure
# paths (non-zero exit, malformed JSON, a run outliving its timeout, a binary
# that does not exist), one printing an empty SUCCESS payload (a real answer
# that must render NO cell rather than an empty bordered box), and a `qml`
# module whose fixture imports qs.Core and reads Theme, proving a loaded user
# component shares the shell's own engine.
#
# No drive step decides any of that: Bar/layout.js resolves it from
# settings.json at startup, so the frame is the whole claim. Every other leg
# leaves the `bar` key out entirely, which is itself the no-config-fallback
# proof.
