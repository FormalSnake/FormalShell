# shellcheck shell=bash
# shellcheck disable=SC2034,SC2154  # dev/smoke.sh reads leg_* and supplies shot_dir, the *_bin paths and fail()
# --clipssh: the menu's clipssh route driven the way a user drives it, over
# `menu activate` (the rig's Enter stand-in), against a PATH-shimmed clipssh
# speaking the real one's output contract: `box` takes six seconds and
# succeeds, `nohost` fails at once.
#
# What is under test is the shell's own path (row -> `@ipc:clipssh.send:` ->
# ClipsshService -> Process -> exit code -> toast plus the bar indicator that
# is up for exactly as long as the process runs), not whether the rig can
# reach an ssh host, so the shim stands in for the binary the same way the
# gpu leg's nvidia-smi does. It records every invocation, which is the one
# claim no frame can make: the alias the row carried reached the command
# line.
#
# Four frames off one timeline: the route's own rows, the transfer in flight
# (indicator cell up, SENDING toast beside it), the same transfer landed
# (COPIED, carrying the remote path the shim printed), and the failure card
# carrying clipssh's own `Error:` line. The two transfers are sequential on
# purpose: the service refuses a second while one is in flight, so an overlap
# would test the refusal rather than the failure path.
#
# The shim ends the way the real one does, wl-copying the remote path as
# text, and wl-copy leaves a daemon behind serving it with clipssh's stderr
# still open. So the leg also reads, off `bar room` and `debug dump`, that
# the indicator is up mid-flight and gone with the COPIED toast as soon as
# clipssh exits, not at the next copy, and off wl-paste that the clipboard
# then holds the path.
