# --panel-anchor proves the one thing `panel toggle` gained in M53: an open
# with no click behind it still hangs its card under the cell that owns the
# panel, instead of at the end of the bar where an anchorless open puts it.
#
# The default right region cannot show that. Every panel-bearing cell there
# sits within half a card's width of the screen edge, so geometry.js's own
# clamp lands a cell-anchored frame on exactly the x an anchorless one gets,
# and the two frames are pixel-identical. This leg therefore puts the audio
# cell in the LEFT region, where the anchored card lands against the left
# screen padding and the anchorless one is still 1500px away.
#
# The claim is read off the screen rather than off a reply: one 200x100 crop
# of the same box under the left region, taken once with the panel toggled
# (anchored) and once with it opened (anchorless), and the two asserted to
# differ. Nothing else in that box moves between the two frames, since it
# holds neither the bar nor the clock, so a difference there is the card
# being in it exactly once.
