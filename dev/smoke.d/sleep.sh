# --sleep suspends the machine through logind with the session unlocked and
# reads the lock back after wake. `sudo systemctl suspend` is the real path:
# logind signals PrepareForSleep(true), waits on every delay inhibitor, then
# starts suspend.target. Only the kernel's freeze is stubbed (nix/testvm.nix
# carries why), and the stub stamps the millisecond logind got there, which
# has to come after the shell let its inhibitor go with the surface secure.
# The FormalShell delay inhibitor is read off `systemd-inhibit --list` before
# the suspend and again after wake, when it has to be held again.
#
# The whole thing runs in light mode over a dark wallpaper at a tenth of the
# motion speed, with a sampler grabbing quarter-size frames throughout: the
# lock has to be black while logind holds the machine asleep (the blank goes
# up before the inhibitor is let go), fade in after wake, blank again on
# `lock.blankAfterSeconds` and wake on a real Shift press. From the first
# black frame on, no frame's mean luminance may rise past the settled lock
# frame's: a light theme's background showing through any of those fades is
# the white flash e1504g showed on a lid open in a dark room. The stub's 2s
# is under the 3s a real resume needs before the lock holds its blank until
# input, so the wake here is the short sleep's own fade back in.
