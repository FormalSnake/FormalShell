# --deform proves the velocity deform (M54 D7): a card arriving does not stop
# dead on its rect. It passes it, squashes into the bar it came out of, and
# unwinds through its rest rather than snapping to it, so the last frame of an
# open is the same rect as a card that has been sitting there for a second.
#
# Two numbers off one burst, both the card's own silhouette in the band under
# the bar's line, measured as the bounding box of everything that differs
# between a frame and the same output with the panel shut:
#
#   past    at least one frame reaches further down than the resting card
#           does. Both halves of the movement land there: the emerge rides a
#           spatial curve, whose control point above 1 carries the card a few
#           pixels beyond rest, and the deform stretches it along the same
#           direction of travel on top of that.
#   rest    the last frame of the burst is the resting box exactly, all four
#           numbers. The springs are still integrating well past the travel
#           they were driven by (stiffness 200, damping 16, so a couple of
#           tenths), which is why that sample sits three clocks out rather
#           than at the end of the travel.
#
# The band starts one row under the bar's own line: a joined card opens a gap
# in that line and the cell that owns the panel draws a mark of its own, and
# both are differences that are not the card. Everything from there down is,
# including the two fillets, which is why the box is a box and not a height.
#
# The samples are armed BEFORE the ipc call: grim's own start-up costs about
# as much as the first half of the travel, so a capture asked for once the
# call has returned lands past it (panel_emerge.sh's finding).
