# --osd drives the bottom-centre pill four ways off one timeline. It opens
# with the entrance itself, at a tenth of its speed (`debug motionScale`),
# sampled across the travel into osd-emerge-1..N.png over a 400x90 band at
# the bottom of the output, with a bare-desktop frame of the same band taken
# first and the pill's resting pose at the end (osd-rest.png): the pill buds
# off the bottom line (M57 D8), so an early frame has its ink on the output's
# very last row, and at rest it is a plain pill a screenPadding clear of it.
# The pill is retriggered on every frame, which is what holds it up through
# a travel many times its own 1.6s auto-hide.
#
# Then, back at full speed, the three kinds off the original timeline: a
# manual `osd volume` (osd-manual.png), a real `wpctl set-volume` (the
# AudioService.changed auto-show trigger, this run's own SMOKE_OK frame),
# then `osd brightness` (osd-brightness.png). The VM has a pipewire null
# sink but no backlight device, so the brightness frame proves the surface
# renders that kind honestly (0%, empty track), not that hardware exists.
# The sink is set to a second value first, because pipewire outlives the
# session: re-setting an already-30% sink changes nothing, `changed` never
# fires, and the auto-show leg would photograph an empty screen. That half of
# the timeline is anchored 26s into the drive rather than run straight off
# the entrance, so its own spacing is what it always was however long the
# sampling took.
#
# The entrance probes are pinned to the bare rig's own numbers, so
# `--bar-position bottom --osd` and `--frame --osd` photograph the two cases
# with a real line under the pill and leave them out; those combinations are
# read by eye.
#
# Ridden by --pantheon the claim turns over (M60 T2): a popover has no line to
# come out of, so the pill fades in a few pixels under its rest and the
# output's last row stays bare through the whole entrance. Both habits are
# then read against the same resting pose.
