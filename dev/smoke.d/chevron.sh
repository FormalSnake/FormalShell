# --chevron points bar.layout at today's exact default right region reordered
# around one `chevron` name: the five governed cells lead the region, then the
# chevron, then battery/audio/network sit outboard against the screen edge. A
# right-region chevron governs what PRECEDES it, so those five are never on
# the strip at all (M52): they are drawn in the second bar the cell opens, the
# way the tray lives behind its own dots, and everything outboard of the
# chevron keeps its x whether that bar is up or not.
#
# `bar chevron expand` stands in for a click on the cell (no synthetic pointer
# here), deliberately with no region argument, since a single-chevron layout
# is meant to infer it. The two PNGs are asserted to differ: M24 shipped a
# correct IPC contract over a bar that rendered nothing, and these two frames
# were byte-identical the whole time with every dump passing.
#
# Ridden by --pantheon it also carries the ink claim (M66): that band reads
# its paint off the wallpaper, so the leg sets a flat bright field first and
# the strip goes to dark ink over it. The card the chevron opens is not the
# band, and its cells have to say so, which is read off one patch of the
# frame inside the card: a dark plate with light words on it, not the band's
# black ink drawn onto it.
#
# Last, the second bar under a real pointer behaving like a panel (owner,
# 2026-10-09: it ignored a click outside, and a click on another cell opened
# that cell's panel beside it): the chevron clicked open, a click on the
# desktop shutting it, then open again and a click on the clock shutting it
# and opening the calendar in its place.
#
# Then the card's own size (owner, 2026-10-09: "the chevron panel doesnt
# resize"). The group carries one more cell, a `command` module reading a
# file, which answers nothing at first and so is no cell at all: the card
# opens exactly as it did without it, and the click above lands where it
# always did. With the weather panel still hanging off the card, the file
# gets a long label, so a cell appears inside the open card; then, panel
# shut, it gets a short one under `debug motionScale 1000`. Each settled
# `bar chevron status` has to show the card around its cells, the same
# padding before the first as after the last, and the samples taken through
# the shrink have to catch the card at a width between its two rests: it
# travels to its new size the way a panel card does, rather than keeping the
# size it opened at or jumping.
