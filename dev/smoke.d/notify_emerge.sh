# --notify-emerge proves how one notification arrives (M60 T4), which the
# --notify leg cannot: that leg's two frames land seconds after the last
# notify-send, by which time every entrance is long over. So one sticky
# critical notification is fired at a tenth of its speed (`debug motionScale`,
# the same instrument --menu-emerge and --join use) and photographed frame by
# frame, back to back, with the wall clock stamped after each capture.
#
# Read as a ladder of probes down the card's own centre column, each covered
# when it is NOT byte-identical to the same probe in the frame taken before
# the notification existed: something the desktop does not draw is being drawn
# there, which is the card. The desktop here carries no scrim, so that is the
# whole classifier.
#
# The claim: the card unfolds off its own top edge (a rotation about it from
# face down, through a few degrees past upright, to nothing), so its drawn
# height is a FRACTION of its resting height for most of the entrance. At
# least one frame covers some of the ladder and not all of it, the covered
# rungs are always the shallow ones, and the depth never goes back up.
#
# --pantheon only, and it says so rather than branching: the unfold is that
# habit's, and the row habit's own arrival travels in from past the anchored
# screen edge while the velocity deform squashes it about the midpoint of that
# edge (M54 D7), which is a card whose top and bottom leave the ladder
# together. That is --notify's frame and --deform's burst, not this one's.
#
# The card's rect is not hardcoded: it is the difference between the settled
# frame and the one taken before the notification existed, measured over the
# output below the bar so the bell cell's own unread mark is not in the box.
#
# Critical rather than normal on purpose: a sticky popup (expiresAt 0, see
# model.js's expire) is still there for the settled frame at the end of a
# ladder that runs for several seconds, and its urgency changes the rim's
# colour and nothing about the geometry this leg reads.
