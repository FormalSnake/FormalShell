# Before the first connect, a saved profile for FORMALGHOST, an SSID neither
# radio broadcasts: it has to stay out of the panel's Networks list and its

# keys walk the cursor onto it and press Enter. Read off `network status`
# (`inRange`, `knownOpen`) and off tesseract over the two frames.
#
# Everything is strictly ordered, so it is one script. Each poll writes over
# its own path, so what the loop last saw is exactly what the assertions read
# back, never a stale earlier snapshot passing by accident.
