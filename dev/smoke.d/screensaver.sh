# track so MediaService.isPlaying is genuinely true. Three claims off one
# timeline: the live media guard holds the screensaver off while the session
# is already idle; killing the player alone auto-activates it, with no
# `screensaver start` call involved; and the manual IPC start/stop path works
# independently of the idle timer. The activation's own output is checked
# against the compositor's monitor list, and a read-only frameInfo poll
# watches the cycle counter leave 0, which is the effect converging, holding
# and rerolling with nothing nudging it.
#
# The rest of the multi-head rules (port prefixes, the internal/external
# aliases, what a plug or unplug does to a run in flight) live in
# tests/tst_display_priority.qml, since this session has one head.
