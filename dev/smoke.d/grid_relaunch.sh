# --grid-relaunch: the root grid after a launch that re-ranks it. Ten apps
# are staged, so two sit past the eight root cells; each is found by search
# and launched, which records the launch, rebuilds the tree as the launcher
# closes and moves that app to the head of the grid. `menu status`'s
# `cells` is read on every reopen: eight ids, none of them twice, the
# launched app first. It summons and closes the launcher on its own clock
# from t=3, so it does not ride another launcher leg (`--app-grid`,
# `--menu`): run it on its own.
