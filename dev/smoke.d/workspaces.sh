# --workspaces proves the bar's workspace indicator is ONE pill that travels
# rather than a per-dot width (M48). The dots hold fixed slots, so the only
# thing that may move between two settled frames is the pill.
#
# A second foot window is spawned on workspace 2 first: workspaces.js hides
# an empty unfocused workspace, so without it the second dot would vanish on
# the way back and the frames would be comparing different rows rather than
# the same row with the pill in two places.
#
# `hyprctl dispatch workspace 1` then fires and the run takes a burst of
# frames across the pill's own travel, plus a settled one three seconds on.
# Every frame is cropped to the workspace cell alone, never the whole bar:
# the switch changes the active-window title two cells over, so a wider crop
# would differ between any two frames whether or not the indicator moved.
#
# Two assertions. The settled cells either side of the switch must differ,
# which is the pill occupying a different slot. And at least one burst frame
# must differ from the settled cell, which says the indicator was still
# resolving after the switch had landed: at `motion.enabled=false` every one
# of these tokens is 0 and all four frames would be the settled cell exactly.
#
# The burst frames also carry the picture the assertions do not claim: the
# pill's two edges run `emphasized`, the trailing one over twice that clock
# (M54 D2), so between roughly a quarter and a whole clock past the switch
# the pill is one shape stretched across both dots rather than a pill at
# either end. That is what the crops are for reading by eye. It is left out
# of the assertions on purpose: a nested software-rendered session cannot
# promise which frame a screencopy commits, and the durations themselves are
# pinned in tests/tst_theme_tokens.qml.

# The pill's own clock (Theme.motion.emphasized, M54 D2/D11) and the delay
# this rig costs between the dispatch and the shell's first frame carrying
# it, both in milliseconds. Every burst frame is that delay plus a fraction
# of the clock, so moving the token moves the sampling with it instead of
# leaving the burst pinned to a duration that has gone.
#
# The fractions straddle the widest part of the stretch, which is earlier
# and narrower than the clock alone suggests: M3's emphasized curve puts
# 86% of the travel in its first third, so the leading edge is nearly home
# by 0.3 of a clock while the trailing edge, on twice that, is barely a
# third of the way. The gap between them peaks around a quarter of a clock
# past the shell's first frame and is closed again by three quarters.
#
# A fraction says when a capture is ASKED for, not when the compositor
# commits the frame it answers with, and all four are in flight at once, so
# the frames read later than they are armed and not always in that order.
# That is why the first one is negative and still lands inside the travel.
