# shellcheck shell=bash
# shellcheck disable=SC2034,SC2154  # dev/smoke.sh reads leg_* and supplies shot_dir, the *_bin paths and fail()
# --notify: four notify-sends into the private bus, then `notifications
# expand on/off`, the rig's stand-in for hovering the stack (there is no
# synthetic pointer here). The expanded frame lands a beat after the toggle
# so the reflow has settled, and `expand off` restores the collapsed pile the
# run's own smoke.png reads.
#
# Three of the four are the icon resolution order (M48 D4), which only the
# expanded frame can show: a collapsed stack draws the front card's content
# and empty chrome for the peeks behind it. One carries a fixture PNG by
# absolute path, one a themed name this session's own icon theme really
# carries, and one no icon at all, which has to fall back to the card's bell.
# The theme is staged into the isolated HOME rather than pulled off the
# machine: the rig hands the session `XDG_DATA_DIRS=$iso_home/.local/share`
# and nothing else, so an icon theme installed system-wide (there is none in
# nix/testvm.nix either) would be invisible to it. hicolor is the one theme
# every other theme falls back to, which is why a name dropped in there
# resolves without the session having to agree on a theme name.
#
# The two layer dumps are the sonner stack's own claim (M48): the toast
# surface is the whole output and stays that size while it is mapped, so the
# collapse/expand reflow moves cards inside a static window instead of
# resizing a layer surface the compositor would then animate against the
# shell's own motion.
