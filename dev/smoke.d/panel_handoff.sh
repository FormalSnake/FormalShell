# --panel-handoff proves what M53 D5 asks of one panel replacing another: not
# two cards crossing, one card. The incoming card is seeded on the outgoing
# one's rect, the outgoing window is cut on the tick the travel starts, while
# the two are still exactly on top of each other, and the one card left
# travels to its own place with its new contents coming up over the first
# part of that travel (M54 D9). So at no instant is there a card at both
# resting places and at some instant there is one between them.
#
# The default right region cannot show that: every panel-bearing cell there
# is within half a card's width of the screen edge, so geometry.js's clamp
# lands both cards on the same x and the whole travel is a height change.
# This leg therefore puts `audio` alone in the LEFT region and `network`
# alone in the RIGHT one, which parks the two cards ~1500px apart.
#
# Four boxes in the band just under the bar carry the claim, all cropped out
# of full frames afterwards rather than sampled live:
#   left  over the audio card's resting place
#   right over the network card's
#   gap   the 1120px between them, bare desktop at both rests
#   band  the whole strip, for the settled frame
# A card is 380 wide and the two end boxes are 1300 apart, so one card can
# never be in both: `left is bare OR right is bare` holds for every frame of
# a handoff and fails for a pair crossing. The gap box is what a card in
# transit is in, for most of the travel, and nothing at rest is in it, so it
# says the card really moved rather than swapping ends. It is a box rather
# than the whole band on purpose: the Wi-Fi list
# rescans during the run, so a comparison that takes in the network card's
# own rows answers "different" whether anything moved or not.
#
# Five samples, each armed BEFORE the ipc call rather than after it: grim's
# own start-up costs about as much as the travel does here, so a capture
# asked for once the call has returned lands past the end of it every time.
# Arming first spends that start-up during the round trip instead. The
# spread runs wide because what is left, the round trip itself, is worth a
# couple of hundred milliseconds on this rig and is not the same twice.
#
# The five are the incoming window's own map plus a fraction of the travel's
# clock (Theme.motion.spatial, M54 D2), so a change to the token moves the
# sampling with it rather than leaving it pinned to a duration that has gone.
# The travel is front-loaded, which is why three of the five sit inside its
# first third: that is where a card is between the two rests.
