# shellcheck shell=bash

# --capture-edit drives the SAVED notification's EDIT action, the most
# owner-visible part of the capture flow (the misbinding that shipped for
# weeks was found by the owner, not by this suite). `screenshot full` is the
# plain grim/wl-copy pipeline, the same one `pick`'s default processing hands
# off to once a region is chosen: the notify/edit half under test does not
# depend on which route picked the geometry, and --capture already covers the
# picker's own keyboard model. Once `status` settles the SAVED toast has
# already fired from inside the same handler, so the frame taken next
# carries its thumbnail and its EDIT action. `screenshot edit ""` is the
# exact call that action invokes, reachable without synthetic click delivery
# into an Overlay-layer surface.
#
# The editor is a shim that logs the argv it was handed. What needs proving
# is the shell's own path (capture, save, notify, action, spawn, argv), not
# whether a real GTK4 app renders in a VM. It is pointed at through
# settings.json's `screenshot.editor` rather than shadowing `tensaku-edit`
# on PATH: the scaffold owns the shell's launch script, so a leg has no seam
# to prefix its PATH with, and the config key is the shell's own documented
# handoff (ScreenshotIpc.qml's FS_EDITOR) reaching the same spawn.
#
# A real foot window filling the screen with a known solid colour is the
# fixture, so the SAVED thumbnail shows scaled colour rather than an empty
# desktop that would look identical to the card's own background.
