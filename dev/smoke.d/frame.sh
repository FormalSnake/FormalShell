# shellcheck shell=bash

# --frame pins `frame.thickness` (10) in the settings fixture, so the screen
# frame paints round the bar for the run's own frame, and rides whichever
# bar edge the run has (`--bar-position left --frame` is the frame wrapping
# a left bar). What the screenshot cannot say is asserted off `hyprctl -j
# layers`: the bar's own window grown to the size of the output (it paints
# the ring, Bar.qml), and a formalshell:frame-zone on every edge, since
# those zones are what keep windows inside the cut-out.
#
# The last assert is on the wire instead, which is why this leg turns
# WAYLAND_DEBUG on: the framed bar has to reserve nothing at all, and the
# only place that shows is the exclusive zone it sent. A window that kept a
# strip's zone still arranges before the overlay zones reserve, so it lands
# on the whole output anyway and every pixel and every layer box above look
# right, until the same shell starts with the config already in place and
# the zone it froze on is 0. That was the bar drawing its ring one bar
# thickness in from the left edge and off the right one (e1504g,
# 2026-08-26); -1 is the only value that holds either way.
