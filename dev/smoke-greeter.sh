# greetd smoke (M8 Task 2): drives the real greetd instance's default_session
# (the formalshell-greeter compositor nix/testvm.nix declares) through a full
# login, typed via wtype into the greeter's own Wayland session rather than
# an IPC shortcut (the same "verify the action, not the input method" idiom
# dev/smoke.sh's --lock leg already uses). Prints
# the pre-auth (clock + input cell) and post-auth screenshots plus the
# session log, proving the real create_session/auth_message/start_session
# exchange happened rather than just "it renders".
#
# Unlike dev/smoke.sh's own ephemeral nested compositor (composed fresh
# every run by that script), greetd's default_session is a persistent system
# service declared once in nix/testvm.nix — driving it means finding the
# ALREADY-RUNNING greeter session rather than spawning a new one, and
# reaching from this script's own "test" account into the separate `greeter`
# system account's Wayland session. Root (passwordless sudo, already wired
# for --lock's own wtype use) bypasses the greeter runtime dir's 0700 mode
# outright, the same way it bypasses any other user's file permissions, so
# grim/wtype run via `sudo env ...` here rather than as the `greeter` user
# itself.
#
# `sudo systemctl restart greetd` up front makes every run idempotent: once
# a login succeeds, greetd moves on to the authenticated user's own session
# and the default_session compositor this script talks to is gone — the
# restart forces a fresh greeter back up regardless of what a previous run
# (or a fresh boot) left running.
