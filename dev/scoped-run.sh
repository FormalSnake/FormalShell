#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Runs a command inside the VM as a transient systemd user scope, so the
# whole tree it starts (nested Hyprland, its dbus-run-session, the shell,
# every client) lives in one cgroup that can be stopped as a unit. Without
# it the tree outlives an ssh drop: a command session has no tty to hang up,
# and `timeout` puts Hyprland in a process group of its own. Called by
# dev/vm.sh's vm_run; do not run it by hand on a host.
#
#   dev/scoped-run.sh <unit> <command string>
#
# Three ways the scope ends: the command exits, vm.sh stops it from the mac
# when its own side is signalled, or the watcher below sees the ssh session
# that started it gone (a SIGKILLed mac side). RuntimeMaxSec is the backstop.
#
# The VM's slot is held by one run at a time (dev/vm-lock.sh), so any scope
# or Hyprland still here at start is a leftover of a finished run.
