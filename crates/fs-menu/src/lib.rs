//! The launcher's pure logic: the tree model, fuzzy search, cursor and key
//! policy, launch frecency, the calculator, toggle conditions, route icons,
//! the providers that build each source's rows, clipboard history and emoji
//! detection, and window matching for app rows.
//!
//! Everything here is a function over plain data. Providers take their live
//! source as an argument and return nodes, so a caller can recompute one
//! source alone and re-attach it with `providers::attach_children`.
