//! Arming state machine for one hot corner. No clock of its own: every
//! transition takes the caller's `now_ms`, so the whole rule set is testable
//! head-on.
//!
//! The problem it exists for: firing a corner maps the action's own surface
//! (the lock plate, the screensaver overlay) over the corner, which takes the
//! pointer with it. When that surface goes away the compositor hands the
//! pointer straight back to a corner the cursor never really left, and the
//! enter that arrives is indistinguishable, on its own, from a fresh
//! approach. Re-arming on that enter relocks the session the instant it is
//! unlocked, under a parked cursor.
//!
//! The rule: after the action ends, the corner stays disarmed until the
//! pointer has genuinely left the corner and a quiet period has passed since
//! the end.
//!
//! The action's end is the moment its covering surface unmaps, not the moment
//! the action reports itself inactive: the screensaver keeps covering the
//! corner through its fade, and a cooldown started before that runs out under
//! the cover. `on_action_end` takes `pointer_in_corner`, computed by the
//! caller from the compositor's cursor position at that moment. Hover state
//! is no substitute: it reads false while a surface covers the corner, so a
//! cursor parked there looked like one that had left, and the hand-back enter
//! after the cooldown fired the corner again.
//!
//! A hand-back is caught twice over:
//!
//!   1. `pointer_in_corner` at the end. If the cursor is still on the corner,
//!      no leave has happened yet and none is invented.
//!   2. An enter arriving inside the cooldown, which is what the hand-back
//!      looks like when the compositor's position was stale at the unmap. Such
//!      an enter cancels the leave that preceded it instead of firing.
//!
//! Moving out and back in after the cooldown is an ordinary approach again and
//! fires normally.
