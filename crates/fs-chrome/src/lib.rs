//! Pure logic behind the bar and the screen chrome: the bar layout resolver,
//! the workspace cell model, drawer and frame geometry, the panel cursor, the
//! palette dither, the window switcher list, hot corner arming and the plugin
//! manifest resolver. Plain data in, plain data out, no IO.

// A NaN input must read as "no value", which `!(x > 0.0)` says and `x <= 0.0` does not.
