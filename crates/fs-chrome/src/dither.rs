//! The palette engine behind the "retro" dither pass.
//!
//! The pass used to posterize each RGB channel independently onto a few
//! evenly spaced steps with a Bayer bias tipping a channel across a step
//! boundary. A flat region whose color sits near a step boundary then
//! dithered forever (a monotone wallpaper speckled end to end), and the two
//! colors being mixed were a full step apart, so every dot was maximum
//! contrast. A period-correct image instead carries a small palette chosen
//! for that image, and dithers only between entries that are already
//! neighbors:
//!
//! - [`palette`] derives up to `max_colors` colors from the image itself by
//!   median cut. A solid or near-solid source collapses to a single entry,
//!   which is the whole fix for the dots: its own color is in the palette, so
//!   there is nothing to mix it with.
//! - [`quantize`] picks each cell's nearest palette entry, and only tips it to
//!   the second nearest by the 4x4 Bayer threshold, weighted by how far
//!   between the two the cell actually sits. Cells that land on a palette
//!   entry never dither at all; cells exactly halfway land on a 50/50 checker.
//!
//! Hue survives because entries are real averages of the image's own colors:
//! nothing is forced onto a gray axis and nothing can drift to a hue the
//! source never contained. This is display-side only, nothing here is ever
//! written to disk, and matugen still reads the untouched wallpaper file, so
//! a dithered rendering cannot seed the color scheme.
