//! Which bar widget opens which panel, the one place that mapping lives.
//!
//! The two vocabularies differ where a widget and its panel were never named
//! alike ("battery" opens "power", "clock" opens "calendar", "systemUpdate"
//! registers lowercase), which is why this is a table and not a lowercase
//! call. "microphone" is here because its middle click opens the audio panel;
//! it has none of its own. "activeWindow" is deliberately absent even though
//! it opens the app menu panel: that panel drives the focused window's own
//! menu rather than a shell surface, so a positional keybind landing on it
//! would open something different on every window. Everything else left out
//! (tray, bell, indicators, chevron, launcher, visualizer, keyboardLayout)
//! opens no panel at all, and neither `custom:` modules nor `plugin:` entries
//! are keyed here since [`panel_at`] only looks at builtins.
