//! Popout panels.
//!
//! A panel is one module implementing [`Panel`]: its id, its title and
//! icon, the store topics it reads, a body built from `ui` widgets, the
//! header actions it adds beside the close button, and what its keyboard
//! stops and actions do. [`build`] is where a module is registered against
//! its `panel` name. [`host::Host`] owns everything a panel does not: the
//! card and its motion, the header, the scroll, the size morph, the
//! handoff, the keyboard cursor and its halo, focus, Escape and the click
//! outside.
//!
//! The cursor model: every element marked `.stop(key)` in
//! the body is one stop, in reading order; the first navigation key only
//! reveals the cursor, arrows walk the stops (or step the value on one
//! when [`Panel::steps`] says so), Enter or Space calls
//! [`Panel::activate`], `x` calls [`Panel::delete`], and any other
//! printable key reaches [`Panel::key`].
