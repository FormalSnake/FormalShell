//! A modal card (a drawer on the top edge with a scrim under it): the
//! card budding off the top line on its own full-output surface, which
//! holds the keyboard while open, and the two single-pixel scrim surfaces
//! riding its pose: the band over the top line's own inset, which fades in
//! only as the card lets go of the line (`1 - attach`), and the rest of the
//! output. The launcher, the polkit dialog and the radio atlas are each one
//! of these; the owner lays its content out in `card.content` under
//! `card.clip`.
