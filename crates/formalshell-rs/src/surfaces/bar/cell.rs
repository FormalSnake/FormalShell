//! The cell kit (Components/Cell.qml and the pieces a bar widget is built
//! from: Icon, CellLabel, CellRow, MarqueeText).
//!
//! A cell is one module under `cells/` implementing [`Cell`]: which store
//! slices it reads, how it re-reads them, and the [`View`] it shows (its
//! parts, tone, tooltip and the panel it opens), plus what a click or a wheel
//! notch on it does. The kit measures and draws a view, so a cell never
//! touches the scene; one that needs its own drawing (the workspaces' pill)
//! implements [`Custom`] instead. `cells::build` is where a cell is
//! registered against its `bar.layout` name.
